# shell, never pasted into Claude. Example:
#
#   export GYM_FTP_HOST='ftp://www224.your-server.de'
#   export GYM_FTP_USER='kaywie_0'
#   read -s GYM_FTP_PASS   # types hidden, not stored in shell history
#   export GYM_FTP_PASS
#   ./deploy/upload.sh
#
# Uploads deploy-upload/ (rebuild it first if the frontend changed --
# see README's Deploy section) to /public_html/gym-tracker/.

# running app) -- a reverse-mirror with --delete would wipe the real
# production database and any uploaded files on every re-deploy. The
# tradeoff is old content-hashed JS/CSS bundles from previous builds pile
# up in assets/ over time (harmless -- index.html always points at the
# current ones); clean those out by hand occasionally if it bothers you.
